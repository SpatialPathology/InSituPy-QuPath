## üìÇ Folder Overview

### `qupath/`
Scripts written in Groovy for use with [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io). These scripts help export image data and annotations in formats compatible with InSituPy.

Included scripts:
- `ExportToInSituPy.groovy`: Exports multiplexed IF data including cellular measurements, images as well as nuclear and cellular boundaries. Requires segmentation of cells using e.g. [InstanSeg](https://github.com/instanseg/instanseg). Exported data can be read using `read_qupath` or `read_qupath_project`.
- `ExportOMETIFF.groovy`: Exports OME-TIFF images based on annotations.

Each script is documented in the folder's `README.md`.
